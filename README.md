## Installation

Fork repository and follow the links below for development mode using Expo Go. Will need to download the ExpoGo app on your mobile device as well. When running the project on your laptop can see and update changes using the ExpoGo app on your phone.<br>
Note: your laptop and phone will need to be on the same wifi to work. Currently only Spades Games is built out. Work on one of the other games or create your own!

- React-Native Expo Setup: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?guide=quickstart&platform=ios

I was unable to build the app to put on my phone since I have windows OS on my laptop and iOS for my mobile device but there is lots of documentation on creating an app if your cirumstances are different.
